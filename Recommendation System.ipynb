    "As we see, the content-based method only has to analyze the items and a single user’s profile for the recommendation, which makes the process less cumbersome. Content-based filtering would thus produce more reliable results with fewer users in the system. However, if the content doesn’t contain enough information to discriminate the items precisely, the recommendation itself risks being imprecise. This can be somewhat overcome with Collaborating Filtering which provides recommendations based similarities in the purchase behavior of users. We will discuss this method in last part of this blog series."
